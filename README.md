Py2 assignments

A friend of mine got me interested in coding. I was always curious of the inner-workings of web development and tech so I thought a bootcamp would be the best way to feed my curiosity. I want a career change, and web development is a very attractive field of study. I hope to become a self-sufficent developer and make cool applications with my talents.
